# JagzFX Expert ONE

JagzFX Expert ONE is a configurable Forex solution developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This Expert Advisor (EA) is designed to provide traders with a versatile and customizable trading strategy.

## Risk Management

The Risk Management section of the code allows traders to specify the risk percentage per trade. By adjusting the `RiskPercentage` variable, traders can control the amount of risk they are willing to take on each trade.

## Position Sizing

The Position Sizing section calculates the position size based on the account balance and the specified risk percentage. By adjusting the `AccountBalance` and `RiskPercentage` variables, traders can determine the appropriate position size for their trading strategy.

## Profit Averaging

The Profit Averaging section keeps track of the number of trades and the total profit. This information can be used to analyze the performance of the trading strategy over time.

## Trailing Stop

The Trailing Stop section allows traders to set a trailing stop distance in pips. The code calculates the stop loss and trailing stop levels based on the current bid price and the specified trailing stop distance. If the trade moves in favor, the stop loss level is updated to the trailing stop level.

## Weekly and Intraday Sessions

The code includes variables to specify the start and end times for trading sessions. By adjusting the `StartTime` and `EndTime` variables, traders can define the trading hours that best suit their strategy.

## Custom Indicator Channels

The code includes variables to store the values of custom indicators. Traders can use these variables to incorporate their own custom indicators into the trading strategy.

## Fast Back-Testing

The `FastBackTesting()` function is designed to perform fast back-testing of the trading strategy. Traders can use this function to quickly evaluate the performance of the strategy using historical data.

## Market Volatility

The code includes a variable to store the value of a market volatility indicator. Traders can use this information to adjust their trading strategy based on market conditions.

## Main Expert Advisor Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main function of the Expert Advisor. It checks if it's within the specified trading session and if the custom indicators signal for entry. If the conditions are met, the trading logic is executed. If the trade is profitable, the code updates the profit averaging and checks if the trailing stop is enabled.
